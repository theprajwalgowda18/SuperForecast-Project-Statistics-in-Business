# SuperForecast-Project-Statistics-in-Business

As part of a team project for my statistics class, we employed Bayesian methods to forecast outcomes for various real-world scenarios, focusing on three key questions:

	1.	How far will England advance in the 2024 European Football Championship?
	2.	Will there be a lethal confrontation between the national military forces of Russia and the United States before December 31, 2024?
	3.	Will the Dow Jones Industrial Average finish 2024 higher than 43,000?

Approach and Structure:

	•	Bayesian Prior Formation:
We built initial beliefs (priors) based on historical data and expert opinions, using Bayesian reasoning to update these beliefs as new information emerged.
	•	Cluster Analysis of Key Factors:
For each question, we identified and categorized the most influential factors, such as geopolitical relationships, historical alliances, and economic indicators for the probability of outcomes.
	•	Research and Data Analysis:
We then calculated posterior probabilities by factoring in updated data and information from various sources, including expert forecasters and global events.
	•	Dynamic Updating:
The project emphasized the importance of continuously updating predictions as new, unforeseen events occurred, and how these impacted the likelihood of different outcomes.
	•	Final Forecasting:
To quantify the certainty of predictions, we applied Sherman Kent’s Chart of Certainty, assigning specific probabilities to each possible outcome.
